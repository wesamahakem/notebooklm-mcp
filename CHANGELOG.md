and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.3.2] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- **Focus Prompt Support** - Added `--focus` parameter to `nlm quiz create` and `nlm flashcards create` commands to specify custom instructions.
- **Improved Prompt Extraction** - `studio_status` now correctly extracts custom prompts for all artifact types (Audio, Video, Slides, Quiz, Flashcards).

### Fixed
- **Quiz/Flashcard Prompt Extraction** - Fixed a bug where custom instructions were not being extracted for Quiz and Flashcards artifacts (wrong API index).

## [0.3.1] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- **New AI Client Support** — Added `nlm skill install` support for:
  - **Cline** (`~/.cline/skills`) - Terminal-based AI agent
  - **Antigravity** (`~/.gemini/antigravity/skills`) - Advanced agentic framework
  - **OpenClaw** (`~/.openclaw/skills`) - Autonomous AI agent
  - **Codex** (`~/.codex/AGENTS.md`) - Now with version tracking
- **`nlm setup` support** — Added automatic MCP configuration for:
  - **Cline** (`nlm setup add cline`)
  - **Antigravity** (`nlm setup add antigravity`)
- **`nlm skill update` command** - Update installed AI skills to the latest version. Supports updating all skills or specific tools (e.g., `nlm skill update claude-code`).
- **Verb-first alias** - `nlm update skill` works identically to `nlm skill update`.
- **Version tracking** - `AGENTS.md` formats now support version tracking via injected comments.

### Fixed
- **Skill version validation** - `nlm skill list` now correctly identifies outdated skills and prevents "unknown" version status for Codex.
- **Package version** - Bumped to `0.3.1` to match release tag.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-02-13

### Added
- **Shared service layer** (`services/`) — 10 domain modules centralizing all business logic previously duplicated across CLI and MCP:
  - `errors.py`: Custom error hierarchy (`ServiceError`, `ValidationError`, `NotFoundError`, `CreationError`, `ExportError`)
  - `chat.py`: Chat configuration and notebook query logic
  - `downloads.py`: Artifact downloading with type/format resolution
  - `exports.py`: Google Docs/Sheets export
  - `notebooks.py`: Notebook CRUD, describe, query consolidation
  - `notes.py`: Note CRUD operations
  - `research.py`: Research start, polling, and source import
  - `sharing.py`: Public link, invite, and status management
  - `sources.py`: Source add/list/sync/delete with type validation
  - `studio.py`: Unified artifact creation (all 9 types), status, rename, delete
- **372 unit tests** covering all service modules (up from 331)

### Changed
- **Architecture: strict layering** — `cli/` and `mcp/` are now thin wrappers delegating to `services/`. Neither imports from `core/` directly.
- **MCP tools refactored** — Significant line count reductions across all tool files (e.g., studio 461→200 lines)
- **CLI commands refactored** — Business logic extracted to services, CLI retains only UX concerns (prompts, spinners, formatting)
- **Contributing workflow updated** — New features follow: `core/client.py` → `services/*.py` → `mcp/tools/*.py` + `cli/commands/*.py` → `tests/services/`

## [0.2.22] - 2026-02-13

### Fixed
- **Fail-fast for all studio create commands** — Audio, report, quiz, flashcards, slides, video, and data-table creation now exit non-zero with a clear error when the backend returns no artifact, instead of silently reporting success. Extends the infographic fix from v0.2.21 to all artifact types (closes #33)

## [0.2.21] - 2026-02-13

### Added
- **OpenClaw CDP login provider** — `nlm login --provider openclaw --cdp-url <url>` allows authentication via an already-running Chrome CDP endpoint (e.g., OpenClaw-managed browser sessions) instead of launching a separate Chrome instance. Thanks to **@kmfb** for this contribution (PR #47)
- **CLI Guide documentation for `nlm setup` and `nlm doctor`** — Added Setup and Doctor command reference sections, updated workflow example, and added tips. Cherry-picked from PR #48 by **@997unix**

### Fixed
- **Infographic create false success** — `nlm infographic create` now exits non-zero with a clear error when the backend returns `UserDisplayableError` and no artifact, instead of silently reporting success (closes #46). Thanks to **@kmfb** (PR #47)
- **Studio status code 4 mapping** — Studio artifact status code `4` now maps to `"failed"` instead of `"unknown"`, making artifact failures visible during polling. By **@kmfb** (PR #47)

### Changed
- **CDP websocket compatibility** — WebSocket connections now use `suppress_origin=True` for compatibility with managed Chrome endpoints, with fallback for older `websocket-client` versions

## [0.2.20] - 2026-02-11

### Added
- **Claude Desktop Extension detection** — `nlm setup list` and `nlm doctor` now detect NotebookLM when installed as a Claude Desktop Extension (`.mcpb`), showing version and enabled state.

### Fixed
- **Shell tab completion crash** — Fixed `nlm setup add <TAB>` crashing with `TypeError` due to incorrect completion callback signature.

## [0.2.19] - 2026-02-10

### Added
- **Automatic retry on server errors** — Transient errors (429, 500, 502, 503, 504) are now retried up to 3 times with exponential backoff. Special thanks to **@sebsnyk** for the suggestion in #42.
- **`--json` flag for more commands** — Added structured JSON output to `notebook describe`, `notebook query`, `source describe`, and `source content`. JSON output is also auto-detected when piping. Thanks to **@sebsnyk** for the request in #43.

### Changed
- **Error handling priority** — Server error retry now executes *before* authentication recovery.
- **AI docs & Skills updated** — specific documentation on retry behavior and expanded `--json` flags.

## [0.2.18] - 2026-02-09

### Added
- **Claude Desktop Extension (.mcpb)** — One-click install for Claude Desktop. Download the `.mcpb` file from the release page, double-click to install. No manual config editing required.
- **MCPB build automation** — `scripts/build_mcpb.py` reads version from `pyproject.toml`, syncs `manifest.json`, and packages the `.mcpb` file. Old builds are auto-cleaned.
- **GitHub Actions release asset** — `.mcpb` file is automatically built and attached to GitHub Releases alongside PyPI publish.
- **`nlm doctor` and `nlm setup` documentation** — Added to AI docs (`nlm --ai`) and skill file.

### Changed
- **Manifest uses `uvx`** — Claude Desktop extension now uses `uvx --from notebooklm-mcp-cli notebooklm-mcp` for universal PATH compatibility.

### Removed
- Cleaned up `PROJECT_RECAP.md` and `todo.md` (outdated development artifacts).

## [0.2.17] - 2026-02-08

### Added
- **`nlm setup` command** - Automatically configure NotebookLM MCP for AI tools (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Gemini CLI, Cursor, Windsurf). No more manual JSON editing! Thanks to **@997unix** for this contribution (PR #39)
  - `nlm setup list` - Show configuration status for all supported clients
  - `nlm setup add <client>` - Add MCP server config to a client
  - `nlm setup remove <client>` - Remove MCP server config
- **`nlm doctor` command** - Diagnose installation and configuration issues in one command. Checks authentication, Chrome profiles, and AI tool configurations. Also by **@997unix** (PR #39)

### Fixed
- **Version check not running** - Update notifications were never shown after CLI commands because `typer.Exit` exceptions bypassed the check. Moved `print_update_notification()` to a `finally` block so it always runs.
- **Missing import in setup.py** - Fixed `import os` placement for Windows compatibility

## [0.2.16] - 2026-02-05

### Fixed
- **Windows JSON parse errors** - Added `show_banner=False` to `mcp.run()` to prevent FastMCP banner from corrupting stdio JSON-RPC protocol on Windows (fixes #35)
- **Stdout pollution in MCP mode** - Replaced `print()` with logging in `auth.py` and `notebooks.py` to avoid corrupting JSON-RPC output
- **Profile handling in login check** - Fixed `nlm login --check` to use config's `default_profile` instead of hardcoded "default"

## [0.2.15] - 2026-02-04

### Fixed
- **Chat REPL command broken** - Fixed `nlm chat start` failing with `TypeError: BaseClient.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'profile'`. Now uses proper `get_client(profile)` utility and handles dict/list API responses correctly. Thanks to **@eng-M-A-AbelLatif** for the detailed bug report and fix in issue #25!

### Removed
- **Dead code cleanup** - Removed unused `src/notebooklm_mcp/` directory. This legacy code was not packaged or distributed but caused confusion (e.g., PR #29 targeted it thinking it was active). The active MCP server is `notebooklm_tools.mcp.server`. Thanks to **@NOirBRight** for PR #29 which helped identify this dead code.

### Changed
- **Updated tests** - Removed references to deleted `notebooklm_mcp` package from test suite.

### Community Contributors
This release also acknowledges past community contributions that weren't properly thanked:
- **@latuannetnam** for HTTP transport support, debug logging, and query timeout configuration (PR #12)
- **@davidszp** for Linux Chrome detection fix (PR #6) and source_get_content tool (PR #1)
- **@saitrogen** for the research polling query fallback fix (PR #15)

## [0.2.14] - 2026-02-03

### Fixed
- **Automatic migration from old location** - Auth tokens and Chrome profiles are automatically migrated from `~/.notebooklm-mcp/` to `~/.notebooklm-mcp-cli/` on first use. Users upgrading from older versions don't need to re-authenticate.

## [0.2.13] - 2026-02-03

### Fixed
- **Unified storage location** - Consolidated all storage to `~/.notebooklm-mcp-cli/`. Previously some code still referenced the old `~/.notebooklm-mcp/` location, causing confusion. Now everything uses the single unified location.
- **Note**: v0.2.13 was missing migration support - upgrade to v0.2.14 instead.

## [0.2.12] - 2026-02-03

### Removed
- **`notebooklm-mcp-auth` standalone command** - The standalone authentication tool has been officially deprecated and removed. Use `nlm login` instead, which provides all the same functionality with additional features like named profiles. The headless auth for automatic token refresh continues to work behind the scenes.

### Fixed
- **Auth storage inconsistency** - Previously, `notebooklm-mcp-auth` stored tokens in a different location than `nlm login`, causing "Authentication expired" errors. Now there's only one auth path via `nlm login`.
- **Documentation typo** - Fixed `nlm download slides` → `nlm download slide-deck` in CLI guide.

## [0.2.11] - 2026-02-02

### Fixed
- **`nlm login` not launching Chrome** - Running `nlm login` without arguments now properly launches Chrome for authentication instead of showing help. Workaround for v0.2.10: use `nlm login -p default`.

## [0.2.10] - 2026-01-31

### Fixed
- **Version mismatch** - Synchronized version numbers across all package files

## [0.2.9] - 2026-01-31

### Changed
- **Documentation alignment** - Unified MCP and CLI documentation with comprehensive test plan
- **Build configuration** - Moved dev dependencies to optional-dependencies for standard compatibility

### Fixed
- **Studio custom focus prompt** - Extract custom focus prompt from correct position in API response

## [0.2.7] - 2026-01-30

### Removed
- **Redundant CLI commands** - Removed `nlm download-verb` and `nlm research-verb` (use `nlm download` and `nlm research` instead)

### Fixed
- **Documentation alignment** - Synchronized all CLI documentation with actual CLI behavior:
  - Fixed export command syntax: `nlm export to-docs` / `nlm export to-sheets` (not `docs`/`sheets`)
  - Fixed download command syntax: use `-o` flag for output path
  - Fixed slides format values: `detailed_deck` / `presenter_slides` (not `detailed`/`presenter`)
  - Removed non-existent `nlm mindmap list` from documentation

## [0.2.6] - 2026-01-30

### Fixed
- **Source List Display**: Fixed source list showing empty type by using `source_type_name` key correctly

## [0.2.5] - 2026-01-30

### Added
- **Unified Note Tool** - Consolidated 4 separate note tools (`note_create`, `note_list`, `note_update`, `note_delete`) into a single `note(action=...)` tool
- **CLI Shell Completion** - Enabled shell tab completion for `nlm skill` tool argument
- **Documentation Updates** - Updated `SKILL.md`, `command_reference.md`, `troubleshooting.md`, and `workflows.md` with latest features

### Fixed
- Fixed `nlm skill install other` automatically switching to project level
- Fixed `research_status` handling of `None` tasks in response
- Fixed note creation returning failure despite success (timing issue with immediate fetch)

## [0.2.4] - 2026-01-29

### Added
- **Skill Installer for AI Coding Assistants** (`nlm skill` commands)
  - Install NotebookLM skills for Claude Code, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, Antigravity, Cursor, and Codex
  - Support for user-level (`~/.config`) and project-level installation
  - Parent directory validation with smart prompts (create/switch/cancel)
  - Installation status tracking with `nlm skill list`
  - Export all formats with `nlm skill install other`
  - Unified CLI/MCP skill with intelligent tool detection logic
  - Consistent `nlm-skill` folder naming across all installations
  - Complete documentation in AI docs (`nlm --ai`)
- Integration tests for all CLI bug fixes (9 tests covering error handling, parameter passing, alias resolution)
- `nlm login profile rename` command for renaming authentication profiles
- **Multi-profile Chrome isolation** - each authentication profile now uses a separate Chrome session, allowing simultaneous logins to multiple Google accounts
- **Email capture during login** - profiles now display associated Google account email in `nlm login profile list`
- **Default profile configuration** - `nlm config set auth.default_profile <name>` to avoid typing `--profile` for every command
- **Auto-cleanup Chrome profile cache** after authentication to save disk space

### Fixed
- Fixed `console.print` using invalid `err=True` parameter (now uses `err_console = Console(stderr=True)`)
- Fixed verb-first commands passing OptionInfo objects instead of parameter values
- Fixed studio command parameter mismatches (format→format_code, length→length_code, etc.)
- Fixed studio methods not handling `source_ids=None` (now defaults to all notebook sources)

### Changed
- **Consolidated auth commands under login** - replaced `nlm auth status/list/delete` with `nlm login --check` and `nlm login profile list/delete/rename`
- Studio commands now work without explicit `--source-ids` parameter (defaults to all sources in notebook)
- Download commands now support notebook aliases (auto-resolved via `get_alias_manager().resolve()`)
- Added `--confirm` flag to `nlm alias delete` command
- Updated all documentation to reflect login command structure

## [0.2.0] - 2026-01-25

### Major Release: Unified CLI & MCP Package (Code Name: "Cancun Wind")

- MCP tools consolidated (e.g., separate `notebook_add_url/text/drive` → unified `source_add`)

## [0.1.14] - 2026-01-17

### Fixed
- **Critical Research Stability**:
  - `poll_research` now accepts status code `6` (Imported) as success, fixing "hanging" Fast Research.
  - Added `target_task_id` filtering to `poll_research` to ensure the correct research task is returned (essential for Deep Research).
  - Updated `research_status` and `research_import` to use task ID filtering.
  - `research_status` tool now accepts an optional `task_id` parameter.
- **Missing Source Constants**:
  - Included the code changes for `SOURCE_TYPE_UPLOADED_FILE`, `SOURCE_TYPE_IMAGE`, and `SOURCE_TYPE_WORD_DOC` that were omitted in v0.1.13.

## [0.1.13] - 2026-01-17

### Added
- **Source type constants** for proper identification of additional source types:
  - `SOURCE_TYPE_UPLOADED_FILE` (11): Direct file uploads (e.g., .docx uploaded directly)
  - `SOURCE_TYPE_IMAGE` (13): Image files (GIF, JPEG, PNG)
  - `SOURCE_TYPE_WORD_DOC` (14): Word documents via Google Drive
- Updated `SOURCE_TYPES` CodeMapper with `uploaded_file`, `image`, and `word_doc` mappings

## [0.1.12] - 2026-01-16

### Fixed
- **Standardized source timeouts** (supersedes #9)
  - Renamed `DRIVE_SOURCE_TIMEOUT` to `SOURCE_ADD_TIMEOUT` (120s)
  - Applied to all source additions: Drive, URL (websites/YouTube), and Text
  - Added graceful timeout handling to `add_url_source` and `add_text_source`
  - Prevents timeout errors when importing large websites or documents

## [0.1.11] - 2026-01-16

### Fixed
- **Close Chrome after interactive authentication** - Chrome is now properly terminated after `notebooklm-mcp-auth` completes, releasing the profile lock and enabling headless auth for automatic token refresh
- **Improve token reload from disk** - Removed the 5-minute timeout when reloading tokens during auth recovery. Previously, cached tokens older than 5 minutes were ignored even if the user had just run `notebooklm-mcp-auth`

These fixes resolve "Authentication expired" errors that occurred even after users re-authenticated.

## [0.1.10] - 2026-01-15

### Fixed
- **Timeout when adding large Drive sources** (fixes #9)
  - Extended timeout from 30s to 120s for Drive source operations
  - Large Google Slides (100+ slides) now add successfully
  - Returns `status: "timeout"` instead of error when timeout occurs, indicating operation may have succeeded
  - Added `DRIVE_SOURCE_TIMEOUT` constant in `api_client.py`

## [0.1.9] - 2026-01-11


### Added
- **Automatic re-authentication** - Server now survives token expirations without restart
  - Three-layer recovery: CSRF refresh → disk reload → headless Chrome auth
  - Works with long-running MCP sessions (e.g., MCP Super Assistant proxy)
- `refresh_auth` MCP tool for explicit token reload
- `run_headless_auth()` function for background authentication (if Chrome profile has saved login)
- `has_chrome_profile()` helper to check if profile exists

### Changed
- `launch_chrome()` now returns `subprocess.Popen` handle instead of `bool` for cleanup control
- `_call_rpc()` enhanced with `_deep_retry` parameter for multi-layer auth recovery

## [0.1.8] - 2026-01-10

### Added
- `constants.py` module as single source of truth for all API code-name mappings
- `CodeMapper` class with bidirectional lookup (name→code, code→name)
- Dynamic error messages now show valid options from `CodeMapper`

### Changed
